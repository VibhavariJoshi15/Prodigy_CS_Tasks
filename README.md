# Cybersecurity Internship Projects - Prodigy InfoTech

This repository showcases five cybersecurity projects completed during my internship at Prodigy InfoTech. Each project explores fundamental security concepts, from classical encryption methods to modern network analysis techniques, demonstrating practical applications of cybersecurity principles.

## Projects

### 1. Caesar Cipher Implementation
- **Description:** A Python-based implementation of the Caesar Cipher featuring both encryption and decryption capabilities. This classical substitution cipher demonstrates foundational cryptographic concepts through character shifting techniques.
- **Technologies:** Python
- **Core Skills:** Cryptographic algorithms, String manipulation

### 2. Image Steganography via Pixel Manipulation
- **Description:** An image steganography tool that conceals and extracts secret messages within digital images by manipulating pixel values. This project illustrates covert communication techniques through LSB (Least Significant Bit) embedding.
- **Technologies:** Python, PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- **Core Skills:** Steganography, Image processing, Data concealment

### 3. Password Strength Assessment Tool
- **Description:** An intelligent password analyzer that evaluates security strength based on multiple factors including length, character diversity, entropy, and common pattern detection. Provides actionable feedback for password improvement.
- **Technologies:** Python, Regular Expressions
- **Core Skills:** Authentication security, Pattern matching, Security best practices

### 4. Keylogger (Educational)
- **Description:** An educational keylogger demonstrating keystroke monitoring mechanisms for security awareness purposes. Captures and logs keyboard input to illustrate potential security vulnerabilities and detection methods.
- **Technologies:** Python, pynput
- **Core Skills:** Ethical hacking concepts, Security awareness, Input monitoring  
- **Note:** Strictly for educational and authorized testing purposes only

### 5. Network Packet Analyzer
- **Description:** A packet sniffing tool built with Scapy that captures and dissects network traffic in real-time. Analyzes protocols, extracts packet headers, and identifies potentially suspicious network activities for security monitoring.
- **Technologies:** Python, Scapy
- **Core Skills:** Network protocols, Traffic analysis, Intrusion detection
